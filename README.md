This project is to clone [Flink official tutorial repository](https://github.com/apache/flink-training).
Following the [tutorial guide](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.15/docs/learn-flink/datastream_api/) 
to learn the core concept of Flink. 

In this project, I have finished all the exercises and passed all unit tests.

The core concepts include:

- [Intro to the DataStream API](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.15/docs/learn-flink/datastream_api/)
- [Data Pipelines & ETL](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.15/docs/learn-flink/etl/)
- [Streaming Analytics](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.15/docs/learn-flink/streaming_analytics/)
